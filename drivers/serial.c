/*
Changes from V1.2.3

	+ The function xPortInitMinimal() has been renamed to 
	  xSerialPortInitMinimal() and the function xPortInit() has been renamed
	  to xSerialPortInit().

Changes from V2.0.0

	+ Delay periods are now specified using variables and constants of
	  TickType_t rather than unsigned long.
	+ xQueueReceiveFromISR() used in place of xQueueReceive() within the ISR.

Changes from V2.6.0

	+ Replaced the inb() and outb() functions with direct memory
	  access.  This allows the port to be built with the 20050414 build of
	  WinAVR.
